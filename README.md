# Migrate-User
This script was written to ensure we were able to copy a users entire Windows profile from one machine to the next. This script already existed in our environment so I can't claim that I wrote it, however I can confidentally say I improved it. Initially, this script would copy everything under the "C:\Users\Username" path, including lots of "unncessary" files such as the Outlook .ost file, including temporary files.
